In this laboratory work, it is necessary to implement obstacle avoidance by a robot with a differential drive. The design of the robot is quite simple: two wheels with motors and a pair of ultrasonic sensors. To estimate the distance traveled, encoders on the motor shaft are used, to orient the robot, its angular velocity and rotation angle are calculated, and the distance to the obstacle is measured by ultrasonic rangefinders.

It is also necessary to use dance avoidance as a method of local navigation. (https://www.scielo.br/j/ca/a/VCrdFB5Pmt8TgF7CKrNS4Bg/?lang=en)
